At this stage Zyper is essentially just a proof of concept, and really is just a way for me to learn
the HTTP protocol and Zig.

- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Built-in support for routing and request handling
- Support for TLS encryption for secure communication
- Ability to handle static files and serve them efficiently
